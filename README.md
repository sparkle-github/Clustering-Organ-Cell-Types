# Clustering-Organ-Cell-Types
My project uses the Tabula Sapiens dataset from the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub (CZ Biohub, SF) to cluster scRNA-seq data by gene expression and biological features, identify distinct cell types and states for insights into organ structure and heterogeneity, and validate results using a developed novel cluster validation algorithm.

### Master's Research Project | San Jose State University

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster organ cell types based on gene expression data. The goal was to identify distinct cell subpopulations to aid in medical/research application, e.g., early disease detection.

**Key Objectives:**
* Preprocess large-scale biological datasets (~12GB).
* Implement dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE).
* Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to categorize cell types.
* Visualize clusters for biological interpretation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** Scanpy, Anndata, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook



## ⚠️ Dataset Information
**Note:** The full raw dataset used for this project is approximately **12GB** and is NOT included in this repository due to size limitations.
