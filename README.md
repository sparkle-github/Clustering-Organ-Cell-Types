# Clustering-Organ-Cell-Types
My project uses the Tabula Sapiens dataset from the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub to cluster scRNA-seq data by gene expression and biological features, identify distinct cell types and states for insights into organ structure and heterogeneity, and validate results using a developed novel cluster validation algorithm.
